These patches change the internal resolution of the game.  All require the expansion pak to work.  Due to difficulty, they may not fully work throughout the entire game, menus will be messed up, or the game may crash after a certain point.  However, they do show-off how the games would be if they were 640 x 480i.  Some patches also include a No AA (No anti-aliasing) patch as well, which will look more jagged, but will improve framerate.  

NoAA - Anti Aliasing disabled (greatly helps performance)
